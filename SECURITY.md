- **Role-Based Access Control**: Admin and user roles with proper permissions
- **Password Hashing**: bcrypt with 12 salt rounds
- **Session Management**: Secure token handling

### Input Protection
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation using Joi schemas
- **XSS Prevention**: Input sanitization and output encoding
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries
- **CSRF Protection**: Token-based protection

### Network Security
- **Rate Limiting**: 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP
- **CORS Configuration**: Restricted to allowed origins only
- **Security Headers**: Helmet.js implementation
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: Production-ready SSL configuration

### Data Protection
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive data in .env files (not in repository)
- **Database Security**: Secure connection and access controls
- **File Upload Security**: Type and size restrictions
- **Activity Logging**: Comprehensive audit trails

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Requirements

### Environment Variables
**CRITICAL**: Never commit .env files to the repository!

Required secure configuration:
```env
# Use a strong, random JWT secret (minimum 32 characters)
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key_here_minimum_32_characters_long

# Use strong database credentials
DB_PASSWORD=your_strong_database_password

# Restrict CORS to your domains only
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://yourdomain.com,https://www.yourdomain.com

# Set production environment
NODE_ENV=production
```

### Database Security
- Use strong passwords for database users
- Limit database user permissions to necessary operations only
- Enable SSL connections for production databases
- Regular database backups with encryption

### Production Deployment
- Always use HTTPS in production
- Configure proper firewall rules
- Regular security updates
- Monitor logs for suspicious activity
